So, this is the start my journey. Retirement from the U.S. Navy after 20 years of service is looming while I try to figure out how to begin a second career in the software development field. But why would someone care about what an older (ancient by some IT industry standards) developer has to say about breaking into the field? Well, I know I am not the only one, and wisdom comes from learning from other people’s mistakes instead of making them yourself even the first time. I will be documenting my process, mindset and lessons learned as I go from being a (soon to be) retired veteran to a software developer. 

My hope is any painful lessons I learn can be documented so that anyone else in a similar situation can avoid yet one more road bump in their journey as well. I will show what resources I have used, document how useful they ended up being and highlight any “A-Ha” moments that may not be as visible to those already “in the know”. Just in creating this blog, one of the biggest challenges I will face is not knowing what I do not know. Anyone that has sage wisdom, feel free to contact me on social media and I will add the advice as I receive it on my journey.
