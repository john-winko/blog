In my previous post, I had a simple markdown file of features to implement with a promise to keep it up to date as features are delivered or new ones queued. I thought having a versioned document would be a good way to show progress as everything gets coded and tested, but after some reflection and my desire to try to get into the “Agile” mindset, I will be using GitHub’s Projects feature to delineate, track and update the projects progress.  This does mean I will lose any snapshot of what my Scrum/Kanban board will look like so I will have to include screenshots for a broad overview. Those with a more vested interest can dig deeper through filters to see which notes were changed/updated through GitHub’s version history.

My first task will be transferring my features list into a GitHub project (in this case, the alpha and future features projects). From there, I can start planning out my sprints, what features need to be completed in each how much time I think it will take each to complete using a [Story Point system]( https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation) . I will do a quick sprint to start for the most basic of functionality and recycle issues as extra features are needed.

The next sprint will be setting up a brokering system to handle state information about the game client, different types of log entries and their corresponding events and generating UI elements based on each.
