No one will hire you if they don’t know who you are or what you can do.  I need a space to show off who I am to anyone that may find me in the weeds of a google search or being peered from a LinkedIn connection. Between medium articles, YouTube playlists and some word of mouth from what little network I have in the industry so far, the common theme is I need a portfolio... more specifically a website that shows off my portfolio, not just GitHub repositories.

But what about my history, my previous career achievements or my personality? Advice so far is to assume that anyone hiring will be ageist and while some may have a veteran’s preference, it would only be considered as a tie breaker to a similarly qualified individual. Unfortunately, my age cannot be completely occluded since being retired will already peg me pushing my 40s at a minimum, but I can be obtuse enough in my about me not to make it glaringly obvious. All my personal accounts have my birth year in the username (younger me thinking that was a good thing), so I have created all new accounts using my full or partial name without any other identifiers.

Next question is how far and wide should I “spread the net” since maintaining social media, websites etc. can almost be exponential in the amount of upkeep to sustain them. For now, I will set up a blog (this one to be exact), a portfolio website, a LinkedIn profile and GitHub repo.  I have never had a creative flair when it came to UX/design so I will have to use a template website for now with the option later to customize or program more features as needed. My resume is already self-contained on LinkedIn, but I will have a link to a .pdf version on the portfolio site for a general version that is easily scraped by recruiters.
