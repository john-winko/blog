I have always had a passion for all things technology related but as a younger individual (read: pre-Y2K) I was especially interested in software and how our most used apps were made. This led to me becoming a coding hobbyist learning different programming languages to make little niche programs and tools. At first it was the age old, what’s the difference between “Hello, World!” writing in one language compared to another. Then it was tinkering with each languages library to see what I could do (and break).  Eventually, I started making trainers for games that were once “Nintendo hard” which led into a rabbit hole I almost did not crawl out of. Low level C code, assemblers, core architectures were all beyond fascinating for me but not having a structured learning path and the relative unavailability of quality documentation or tutorials back in my youth that weren’t pay walled put me into tutorial hell.

Once I scaled back how “bare-metal” I was trying to learn and focused on more high-level languages, I found out quickly I could accomplish much more although not necessarily with as much precision.  Even during my military service, I would make databases and hack office products to be used within the constraints of our immensely complex and sometimes burdensome IT network. I am not without faults though, there were plenty of bad habits that were picked up along the way, hacking my apps to work, rather than learning a better design pattern that would have alleviated my issues to begin with. Today, there is a tutorial for everything so there is never an excuse to not figuring out how to do something (the quality of said tutorials is a separate discussion) so the problem becomes simply not knowing there is a better, easier or faster way.

Now, with new career options on the horizon, I need to hone the skills that make me employable then network those skills to make myself marketable. Part of that path is taking a step back and purposefully ask if there is a paradigm or design pattern that would work better. I will continue my self-study skills and be doing a code bootcamp starting in Feb 2022 (more on that journey later) and hopefully by May of 2022 I will have smoothed out enough rough edges to be considered a full programmer and not just a hobbyist.
