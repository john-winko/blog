So my identity is started, website is running and twitter is… well… there. Now it is time to start a small project to get things running. I have tinkered with a specific tool to run along side a game I play often called Path of Exile, but never to the point of being publicly useable (or privately for that matter).  When it comes to the **how** of making a fully fleshed out app, the methodologies, design patterns and complete letter vomit of industry acronyms gives me flashbacks of [Dead or Alive]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGNiXGX2nLU). 

I need to get in the habit of setting milestones and meeting them like I would working for a client or employer, but should I use Waterfall or be Agile? Should I still work off branches when I am a development team of one? Should I use a specific IDE or language? There is no getting around have a formalized project plan, and after reading some of the [pros/cons]( https://www.macadamian.com/learn/when-to-use-waterfall-vs-agile/) 

I am picking the Agile approach. I have a good idea of what features the app needs, but do not know which ones may not be feasible or what other users may find more important or useful (assuming the project gets any steam within the game community). As I learn more, there will be times I find a methodology that is superior and refactoring code is an inevitability. Using branches goes hand in hand with this so when I do refactor and the code breaks, it will be easier to document the process of getting bad code that works to good code that works **better**. 

I have a long history of loving to hate IDEs. When I started coding with Java, NetBeans was *so cool* until I realized how slow it was compared to paid versions. Visual Studio was out of my price range (until Microsoft came to their senses with a community edition), but I have had a taste of many and there are endless debates to which is *best*. For me, I do not want all the bells and whistles *yet* since it may become and unnecessary roadblock. Luckily, I am financially capable of having a few paid products to help me along the way and the cost/benefit of using Rider and WebStorm is a no-brainer for me.  As I get to know what exactly I want/need from the IDE for a full-time basis, I am sure my preference of IDE/Tools will change in the future.
